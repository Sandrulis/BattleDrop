# BattleDrop

Weekly product battles for early-stage founders. Community votes, promoted leaderboard spots, and a Product Hunt–style feed — Next.js frontend with Supabase auth, project submissions, and admin tooling.

**Repository:** [github.com/Sandrulis/BattleDrop](https://github.com/Sandrulis/BattleDrop)  
**Current version:** `0.1.28` (see [Changelog](#changelog))

---

## Features

### Public

- **Weekly leaderboard** — **published projects** for the displayed battle week from Supabase; project **favicons** on feed rows; promoted insertions from `promoted_slots`; votes disabled until voting opens (demo counts still client-side until DB-backed)
- **Promoted spots** — when `project_promotes` integration is enabled: book from **My Projects** after publishing; fixed positions (before #1, after #5, after #10); highlighted row + badge on home feed; active for a configurable duration (site default, `expires_at` on each booking); **owner-only countdown** (small mono timer after Promoted badge); live expiry drops badge/row without refresh; `#` on promoted rows shows **vote rank** (real position by votes), not feed position
- **Monthly championship** — banner with contender voting and countdown
- **Product pages** (`/products/[id]`) — unified detail view for published projects and owner draft preview; landing screenshot above About; threaded **DB-backed comments** with optimistic post/upvote, **author upvote totals** (`fa-star` after username), and square rounded avatars with initials fallback; launch stats sidebar (Battle week or **Created** date when not in a battle)
- **Archive** — season calendar grouped by month with historical week cards
- **Site identity** — configurable site name and slogan (header, footer, metadata, OG tags)
- **Date & time display** — site-wide defaults with optional per-user overrides
- **Currency display** — site-wide default currency with optional per-user overrides (EUR, USD, GBP)

- **Weekly battle hero** — resolves the **next enabled ISO week** when the current week is disabled; status badge (**Waiting battle week** / awaiting voting / voting open / closed); live countdown to **week start** and **voting opens**; per-week submit price in points; min-project progress bar
- **Weekly battle rules** — sidebar lists dynamic rules for the displayed week (entry fee, min projects, voting hours, one submit per user, one vote per day, pre-voting shuffle)
- **Site poll** — when `integration_poll` is enabled and an admin poll is active, home sidebar shows question + answer options; signed-in users vote once; after voting, progress bars compare each option (percent + count)
- **Pre-voting shuffle** — product order randomised on each page refresh until voting opens (server-side; avoids hydration mismatch)

> Home **leaderboard products**, **promoted bookings**, and **product comments** use Supabase (`published` projects + `promoted_slots` + `project_comments`). **Vote counts** on the home feed are still client-side demo until DB-backed voting ships. Auth, user projects, admin entry counts, and **weekly battle context** (`getHomeBattleWeek()`) are wired to Supabase and per-week settings.

### Auth & projects

- **Google sign-in** — Supabase Auth with session refresh via `proxy.ts`; OAuth callback supports `?next=` return path
- **Submit product** — two-step flow (URL → review details); guests can start without signing in; side panel uses the same resolved battle week as home (`getHomeBattleWeek()`)
  - **Step 1** — enter URL; pasted paths like `/dashboard` resolve to the **site root landing page** (`normalizeProjectSubmitUrl`) for preview, screenshot, and save — not login-gated app routes
  - **Signed-in users** get a duplicate check by **domain** before preview (guests skip client check — duplicate blocked on save)
  - **Step 2** — guests see **Login + Save** (not Save); draft stored in `sessionStorage`, then Google sign-in → return to `/submit` → auto-save
  - **Signed-in users** — standard **Save** button; edit via `/submit?projectId=…` (auth required)
  - Meta fetch (direct + Microlink fallback), favicon, screenshot proxy
  - **Week card** (always visible) — entry fee, live **Voting opens in** countdown, optional **Battle starts at** `X/Y projects` with progress bar when min-projects rule is enabled
- **Duplicate URLs** — signed-in submit flow checks domain before preview; save always checks server-side (active, soft-deleted, any owner)
- **My Projects** — sorted by **created_at** (newest first); list drafts, edit, soft-delete; **Preview** on drafts and published entries (links to `/products/[id]?from=my-projects`); **comment badge** (`fa-comment-alt` + count) after Preview when the project has comments; **Publish** opens modal (target battle week, rules checkbox, entry fee, balance check); published entries show **Week N, YYYY** badge in the action row; **published cards** use battle-week **border + colored drop shadow** (same palette as home status badge); **Promote** published entry when `project_promotes` integration is enabled (spot picker modal shows site promote duration; active booking shows Promoted badge + owner countdown; insufficient points → redirect to **Buy points**)
- **Header balances** — signed-in users see **Points** (`fa-money-bill-wave`), **Upvotes** (`fa-star`), and **Affiliates** (`fa-user-tag` + available referral count when `integration_affiliates` enabled) as `h-8` badges with tooltips; desktop header only — on mobile they appear at the top of the account dropdown
- **Points balance** — clickable → `/buy-points`; same link in publish/promote modals and submit side panel
- **Comment upvote reputation** — total upvotes received on your comments; same total shown after each comment author’s `@handle`
- **Buy points** (`/buy-points`) — frontend-only top-up page (Stripe coming soon); point packages UI, account side panel with pricing reference; `?return=` for back navigation
- **Affiliates** (`/affiliates`) — when `integration_affiliates` is enabled: personal referral link + code, email invites (+), joined/pending stats, account side panel; referral claimed on sign-up via `?ref=` cookie (`bd_affiliate_ref`); account menu link (after My Projects, before Shop); header + home sidebar **Copy link** for signed-in users; **Shop redeem** stats and **How rewards work** only when `integration_shop` is also enabled (otherwise invite-only copy); rates from `shop_affiliates_per_point` via `format-shop-exchange-rate.ts`
- **Shop** (`/shop`) — when `integration_shop` is enabled: exchange **comment upvotes** and **affiliate referrals** for battle points at admin-set rates; account menu link; **red banner** when integration disabled; affiliate redemption also requires `integration_affiliates`
- **User settings** (`/settings`) — date/time and currency preferences with account side panel (member since, last seen, quick links); site name, slogan, and default currency are admin-only

### Admin panel (`/admin-panel`)

- **Overview** — quick links to admin areas
- **Users** — all accounts, admin badge, **points balance** before admin toggle (same icon/style as header), last seen (5‑min throttle; shown in each user's own date/time format)
- **Projects** — placeholder UI
- **Battles** — weekly, monthly, and yearly subnav at `/admin-panel/battles`
  - Year switcher — active year, previous years with real entries, and next year for planning (`?year=`)
  - Weekly — 52 week cards; entry counts from **published projects only**; scrollable list auto-scrolls to active week
  - Week card badges — disabled (💩), min projects (👥 + count), points per submit (💵 + `N points`, not currency symbol)
  - Per-week settings modal — enabled toggle, optional min projects, submit price override (saved via API to `battle_week_settings`)
  - Monthly — 12 month cards; yearly — years with entry counts, starting from active year
- **Settings** — site name, slogan, date/time display defaults, **regional defaults** (default currency), and **battle defaults** (`site_settings` table)
  - Default currency (EUR, USD, GBP) — used for price display when users have no personal override
  - Default submit price (shown in site currency)
  - Default hours until battle starts from ISO week beginning (Monday 00:00)
  - **Promote duration (hours)** — how long one promoted spot stays active after booking (1–168 h; default 168)
- **Todo** — shared admin task board (`admin_todos` table)
  - Two columns: **Tasks** (pending) and **In progress** — each column header shows a **task count** badge on the right
  - Drag-and-drop between columns, reorder within a column, drop indicator line
  - Shared trash zones above and below both columns (drag task there to delete)
  - Add task via header button → modal (title + description)
  - Edit task via pencil icon on each card → modal
- **Integrations** (`/admin-panel/integrations`) — admin-managed third-party service keys (`site_integrations`, migration `019`); add/edit modal (name, key, API key, description); each card shows **Configure**, status badge, and enable toggle on one row; audit log on changes; feature gates: `integration_poll` (home sidebar poll), `project_promotes` (promote booking + feed insertions), `integration_affiliates` (referral program), `integration_shop` (upvote / affiliate → points exchange)
- **Poll** (`/admin-panel/poll`) — create polls with 2–10 answer options (`site_polls`, migration `021`); live vote progress per option; enable one poll at a time for the homepage sidebar; **red warning** when `integration_poll` is disabled (link to Integrations); audit log on create/update
- **Shop** (`/admin-panel/shop`) — exchange rates on `site_settings` (`shop_upvotes_per_point`, `shop_affiliates_per_point`; defaults 5 upvotes / 1 referral per point); **red warning** when `integration_shop` is disabled (link to Integrations); audit log on rate changes

### Security

- **SSRF protection** — user-supplied URLs validated before server fetch (`app/lib/security/safe-url.ts`)
- **Safe OAuth redirects** — `?next=` sanitized against open redirects
- **Rate limits** — public fetch routes (preview, screenshot, check-url) per IP
- **Security headers** — CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy (`next.config.ts`)
- **Input limits** — API validation + DB constraints (migration 009)
- **Admin audit log** — settings, role changes, todo actions, integration changes, poll create/update, and shop rate changes → `admin_audit_log`
- **CI** — npm audit, security unit tests, lint, build, gitleaks (see below)
- **Docs** — [`security-check.md`](security-check.md) (score **8/10**, checklist, remaining work)

### UX patterns

- **Toast feedback** — success/error/info via shared popup (auto-dismiss, pauses on hover)
- **Loading states** — animated spinner + “Loading…” in the content area; header and footer stay visible
- **Tooltips** — shared `Tooltip` component (`role="tooltip"`) with **auto placement** (flips above/below and re-aligns when clipped); never use HTML `title` for hover hints
- **Site header** — desktop: logo, **Archive** (after site name), **Submit product** (`fa-plus`), balance badges, avatar; mobile: logo + hamburger + avatar only — **Archive** and **Submit product** live in the hamburger menu (`fixed` full-width panel below header)
- **Account menu** — Font Awesome icon on every item; **Shop** listed after **Affiliates** when integrations enabled
- **User avatars** — Google profile photos in header menu, settings side panel, admin users list, submit sidebar, and comment threads; square rounded fallback with **initials** from full name or `@handle` (`formatUserAvatarInitials`) when image missing or blocked
- **Header controls** — shared `h-8` sizing via `header-control-styles.ts` (submit link, balance badges, menu button, avatar)
- **Header scroll** — body scroll lock only for mobile nav / mobile user menu, not desktop account dropdown

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- Supabase project (for auth, projects, and settings)

### Install & run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sandrulis/BattleDrop.git
cd BattleDrop
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill in Supabase keys (see below)
npm run db:migrate   # or run SQL files manually in Supabase SQL Editor
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) locally.  
Production: [https://battle-drop.vercel.app](https://battle-drop.vercel.app)

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm start` | Run production server |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run test:security` | Security unit tests (redirect + IP blocklist) |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply `supabase/migrations/*.sql` in order |
| `npm run db:check-migrations` | List required migration files |

---

## Environment Variables

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Required | Where | Description |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes | **Local + Vercel** | Supabase project URL |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes | **Local + Vercel** | Supabase anon/public key |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Yes | **Local + Vercel** | Server-only service role key (site settings, admin ops, duplicate checks) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Yes | **Local + Vercel** | `http://localhost:3000` locally · `https://battle-drop.vercel.app` on Vercel |

## Security & CI

**Local checks** (run before push):

```bash
npm audit --audit-level=moderate
npm run test:security
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run db:check-migrations
```

**GitHub Actions** (on push/PR to `main`):

| Workflow | Job | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| `security-audit.yml` | npm-audit | Dependency audit (`moderate`+) |
| `security-smoke.yml` | smoke | Security tests, lint, production build (placeholder Supabase env — not real keys) |
| `secret-scan.yml` | gitleaks | Secret scanning |

**Dependabot** — weekly npm + GitHub Actions updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`).

Full checklist, API auth matrix, and remaining work: [`security-check.md`](security-check.md).  
CSRF assumptions: [`docs/security/csrf-posture.md`](docs/security/csrf-posture.md).  
Supabase linter cadence: [`docs/security/supabase-linter-review.md`](docs/security/supabase-linter-review.md).

---

## Date & Time Formatting

Display order, separator, and 12h/24h time come from the database — not browser locale.

**Priority (per field):**

1. User preference (`public.users.date_format`, `time_format`, `date_separator` — nullable)
2. Site default (`public.site_settings`)
3. Hardcoded fallback (`DEFAULT_SITE_SETTINGS`)

**Who sees what:**

| Context | Settings used |
|---------|----------------|
| Signed-in viewer (layout, home week range, own pages) | Viewer's effective prefs (user → site → default) |
| Timestamp for a specific user (e.g. admin last seen) | That user's effective prefs |
| Guest | Site defaults only |

**Settings pages:**

| Route | Who | Editable |
|-------|-----|----------|
| `/settings` | Signed-in user | Date format, separator, time format; reset to site defaults |
| `/admin-panel/settings` | Admin | Site name, slogan, date/time defaults, default currency, battle defaults (submit price, battle start hours) |

**Key modules:**

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `app/lib/site-settings/get-site-settings.ts` | Cached site settings read |
| `app/lib/site-settings/format-display-date.ts` | `formatDisplayDate`, `formatDisplayDateTime`, `formatLastSeen` |
| `app/lib/site-settings/resolve-effective-date-time-settings.ts` | Merge user + site prefs |
| `app/lib/users/user-date-time-preferences.ts` | User prefs CRUD + `getEffectiveDateTimeSettingsForUser` |
| `app/components/site-date-settings-provider.tsx` | Client context (`useSiteDateSettings`) |

Do not use `toLocaleString()` / `toLocaleDateString()` for user-visible dates.

---

## Currency Formatting

Price symbols come from the database — not hardcoded `€` strings.

**Priority:**

1. User preference (`public.users.currency` — nullable)
2. Site default (`public.site_settings.default_currency`)
3. Hardcoded fallback (`DEFAULT_SITE_SETTINGS.defaultCurrency` → EUR)

**Who sees what:**

| Context | Currency used |
|---------|----------------|
| Signed-in viewer (layout, home, submit, sidebar) | Viewer's effective currency (user → site → default) |
| Guest | Site default only |
| Admin battle-week settings modal | Site default currency for price input (not admin's personal override) |
| Admin battle-week card badge | Points only (`15 points`) — `formatDisplayPoints`, no currency symbol |

**Settings pages:**

| Route | Who | Editable |
|-------|-----|----------|
| `/settings` | Signed-in user | Currency; reset to site default |
| `/admin-panel/settings` | Admin | Default currency (Regional defaults section) |

**Key modules:**

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `app/lib/battle-week-settings/get-home-battle-week.ts` | Canonical **display week** (`HomeBattleWeek`) and **publish target week** (`getPublishTargetWeek`) |
| `app/lib/projects/project-battle-week.ts` | Week on a project row (`battle_year` / `battle_iso_week` or `created_at` fallback) |
| `app/lib/battle-week-settings/resolveEffectiveWeekSettings()` | Per-week enabled, min projects, effective submit price |
| `app/lib/battle-week-status.ts` | Week timing, display status, badge/border/shadow classes, shuffle gate |
| `app/lib/site-settings/format-display-money.ts` | `formatDisplayMoney`, `formatDisplayMoneyWithPoints`, `formatDisplayPoints`, `formatPointsAmount` |
| `app/lib/site-settings/resolve-effective-currency-settings.ts` | Merge user + site currency |
| `app/lib/users/user-currency-preferences.ts` | User currency CRUD + `getEffectiveCurrencyForUser` |
| `app/components/site-currency-settings-provider.tsx` | Client context (`useSiteCurrency`) |

Amounts (`battle_submit_price`, per-week `submit_price`) are numeric only; currency is display-only. Do not hardcode currency symbols in UI — use `formatDisplayMoney*`. For battle rules and week hero labels, use **`formatDisplayPoints`** (points-only). See `.cursor/rules/single-source-of-truth.mdc` — never duplicate battle-week resolution in pages.

---

## Loading States

Route transitions and async UI use a shared spinner — not skeleton placeholders or blank screens.

**Layout during load:**

```
SiteHeader  (always visible)
main        → spinner + “Loading…”
SiteFooter  (always visible)
```

**Components** (`app/components/loading.tsx`):

| Component | Use when |
|-----------|----------|
| `LoadingSpinner` | Inline (buttons, small panels, Suspense fallbacks) |
| `PageLoading` | Content-area spinner only |
| `SiteRouteLoading` | Route `loading.tsx` on standard pages (header + main + footer) |

**Route `loading.tsx`:**

- **Standard routes** — return `<SiteRouteLoading />` (home, archive, products, submit, my-projects, settings, auth)
- **Admin panel** — return `<PageLoading />`; `app/admin-panel/layout.tsx` already renders header, side nav, and footer

Every page segment has a `loading.tsx` file. New routes should add one following the same pattern.

**Button / action loading:** disable the control and reuse `LoadingSpinner size="sm"` or swap the label to “Loading…”.

See `.cursor/rules/loading-states.mdc` for agent conventions.

## Promoted Spots Logic

Promoted products are visually distinct (badge + border + background) but show their **real vote rank** (`#` prefix), not the paid slot number or visual feed position.

| Spot | Position |
|------|----------|
| 1 | Before organic #1 |
| 2 | After organic #5 |
| 3 | After organic #10 |

Promoted products are excluded from the organic vote ranking to avoid duplicates.

**Integration gate:** create `project_promotes` in **Admin → Integrations** and enable it. When disabled or missing, `isPromotesEnabled()` returns false — no Promote button on My Projects, no promoted insertions on the home feed, `POST /api/projects/[id]/promote` returns `403`, and `getPromotedSlotsForWeek()` returns `[]`.

Bookings persist in `public.promoted_slots` (migration `014`; `expires_at` added in `022`). Users book via **My Projects → Promote** after publishing (integration enabled). Each booking gets `expires_at = now + promoteDurationHours` from `site_settings` (admin default 1–168 hours). `getPromotedSlotsForWeek()` returns only non-expired rows — expired slots free the position and drop off the feed (client ticks every second on home + My Projects). **Project owners** see a small mono countdown after the Promoted badge until expiry. **Points are deducted** on promote (3 / 2 / 1 by spot) and on publish (`submitPrice` from `getPublishTargetWeek()`). Insufficient balance returns HTTP `402` and redirects the client to `/buy-points`.

When every (or most) feed entry is promoted, unplaced promoted slots are still appended to the leaderboard so multiple promoted products remain visible (`build-leaderboard.ts`).

## Supabase Setup

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Enable **Google** auth (Authentication → Providers)
3. Add redirect URLs in **Authentication → URL Configuration**:
   - Site URL (prod): `https://battle-drop.vercel.app`
   - Redirect URLs: `http://localhost:3000/**` and `https://battle-drop.vercel.app/**`
4. Apply migrations (in order):

   | File | Purpose |
   |------|---------|
   | `001_create_users.sql` | `public.users` + auth sync triggers |
   | `002_create_projects.sql` | `public.projects` (drafts) |
   | `003_projects_soft_delete.sql` | `deleted_at` column |
   | `004_users_last_seen.sql` | `last_seen` + throttle RPC |
   | `005_site_settings.sql` | Singleton site config row |
   | `006_user_date_time_preferences.sql` | Per-user date/time columns + update policy |
   | `007_admin_todos.sql` | Shared admin todo board (`admin_todos`) |
   | `008_security_function_hardening.sql` | Function `search_path` + EXECUTE hardening |
   | `009_security_hardening.sql` | Audit log, input limits, atomic todo board RPC |
   | `010_battle_default_settings.sql` | Default submit price + battle start hours on `site_settings` |
   | `011_battle_week_settings.sql` | Per-week battle overrides (enabled, min projects, submit price) |
   | `012_site_default_currency.sql` | Default display currency on `site_settings` |
   | `013_user_currency_preference.sql` | Per-user currency column (nullable) |
   | `014_promoted_slots.sql` | Promoted slot bookings + public read for published projects |
   | `015_project_battle_week.sql` | `battle_year` + `battle_iso_week` on published projects; backfill from `created_at` |
   | `016_user_points.sql` | `users.points` balance; client cannot self-edit; `deduct_user_points` / `credit_user_points` RPC (service_role) |
   | `017_project_comments.sql` | Threaded comments on published projects (`project_comments`) |
   | `018_project_comments_grants.sql` | Grants + `select_own` RLS policy for comment authors |
   | `019_site_integrations.sql` | Admin-managed third-party integrations (`site_integrations`) |
   | `020_project_comment_upvotes.sql` | One upvote per user per comment (`project_comment_upvotes`) |
   | `021_site_polls.sql` | Site-wide polls (`site_polls`, `site_poll_options`, `site_poll_votes`) |
   | `022_site_promote_duration.sql` | `promote_duration_hours` on `site_settings`; `expires_at` on `promoted_slots` |
   | `023_affiliates.sql` | `users.affiliate_code`, `referred_by_user_id`; `affiliate_invites`; protected affiliate fields |
   | `024_shop.sql` | Shop rates on `site_settings`; `shop_*_redeemed` on `users`; `redeem_shop_upvotes` / `redeem_shop_affiliates` RPC |

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

   Or paste each file into **Supabase → SQL Editor**.

   Verify migration 009:

   ```sql
   select to_regclass('public.admin_audit_log');
   select proname from pg_proc where proname = 'sync_admin_todo_board';
   ```

5. Set an admin user: `update public.users set is_admin = true where email = 'you@example.com';`
6. Fill `.env.local` and run `node scripts/test-supabase.mjs`

## Cursor Rules

Agent conventions live in `.cursor/rules/`:

| Rule | Topic |
|------|-------|
| `readme-version-update.mdc` | README **update** → bump version, Changelog since last release |
| `site-date-time-formats.mdc` | Use `formatDisplayDate*` / effective settings; no locale formatters |
| `site-currency-formats.mdc` | Use `formatDisplayMoney*` / effective currency; no hardcoded symbols |
| `toast-feedback.mdc` | Action feedback via `useToast` + `<Toast>` |
| `loading-states.mdc` | `SiteRouteLoading` / `PageLoading`; spinner in content area only |
| `tooltips-not-title.mdc` | Use `Tooltip` component; never HTML `title` for hover hints |

---

## Deployment

Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) by importing the GitHub repo.

**Live app:** [https://battle-drop.vercel.app](https://battle-drop.vercel.app)

### Vercel environment variables

Copy from your local `.env.local` into **Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables**. Enable **Production** (and Preview if needed):

| Variable | Vercel value |
|----------|--------------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Same as `.env.local` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Same as `.env.local` |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Same as `.env.local` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | `https://battle-drop.vercel.app` |

Do **not** add `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` / `DATABASE_URL` to Vercel (local migrations only).

After saving env vars: **Deployments → latest → Redeploy**. A new build is required — editing env alone does not fix a running deployment.

### Checklist

1. Run migrations `001`–`024` on the **production** Supabase project (see [Supabase Setup](#supabase-setup))
2. Add all four env vars above in Vercel (**Production**)
3. Set Supabase **Authentication → URL Configuration** redirect URLs to include `https://battle-drop.vercel.app/**`
4. Redeploy on Vercel
5. Enable GitHub **secret scanning push protection** in repo settings (recommended)

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| **Internal Server Error** on `/` | Supabase env missing on Vercel | Add all four vars, redeploy |
| `Your project's URL and Key are required…` in `update-session.ts` | Same — runtime has no `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` | Copy from `.env.local` → Vercel → **Redeploy** |
| Google sign-in redirects to localhost | Wrong `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` on Vercel | Set to `https://battle-drop.vercel.app`, redeploy |
| Auth works locally but not in prod | Supabase redirect URLs | Add prod callback URL in Supabase dashboard |
| CI build passes but prod fails | GitHub Actions uses placeholder env; Vercel needs real keys | Configure Vercel env separately from CI |

Static assets (`/favicon.ico`, `/_next/static/*`) may work even when pages return 500 — that usually means the app deployed but Supabase env is missing at runtime.

## Versioning & Commits

Version follows `package.json` (`semver`). Every commit message ends with the version tag:

```
Short description of the change. v0.1.13
```

Bump the version in `package.json` when the change is user-facing or notable. Current: `0.1.24`.

When the user asks to **update README**, follow `.cursor/rules/readme-version-update.mdc`: bump version, move `Unreleased` → new changelog section, list all improvements since the last version.

When the user asks to **commit** or **push**, follow `.cursor/rules/github-version-commit.mdc` — every release commit message must end with `. vX.Y.Z`.

- **Comment indicator** — after Preview, `fa-comment-alt` + count when `getProductCommentCount()` > 0; links to product page (see v0.1.18 for DB comments)
- **Cursor rules** — `github-version-commit.mdc` enforces version-tagged commit messages on GitHub push

- **Buy points** (`/buy-points`) — frontend-only package picker (Stripe coming soon); side panel (account, publish/promote prices, quick links); `?return=` back navigation
- **Insufficient points UX** — publish/promote modals and My Projects redirect to buy-points; `PointsBalanceLink` in modals and submit side panel
- **Battle hero** — `upcoming` badge label **Waiting battle week** (was “Waiting”)
- **Admin todo** — task count badge on each column header (Tasks / In progress)

### v0.1.13

**Publish UX, battle week columns & leaderboard polish**

- **Publish modal** — `PublishProjectModal`: target week range, entry fee, rules checkbox; `getPublishTargetWeek()` applies rule #3 (next available week when voting already started on display week)
- **Battle week on projects** — migration `015_project_battle_week.sql`; `battle_year` + `battle_iso_week` set on publish; `project-battle-week.ts` for week resolution and Supabase filters (column match OR `created_at` fallback)
- **My Projects** — published entries show **Week N, YYYY** badge in the Publish-button slot; date range under title
- **Battle hero** — live countdown to week start and voting opens (replaces static “Waiting for this week” copy)
- **Voting gate** — upvote buttons disabled until `voting_open`; feed hint “voting opens soon”
- **Favicons on feed** — `ProjectLogo` + `faviconUrl` on `Product`; home leaderboard and product detail match My Projects / admin favicon display
- **Multiple promoted rows** — `build-leaderboard.ts` appends promoted slots that could not be inserted after organic ranks (fixes one-promoted-only when organic list is empty or short)
- **Query resilience** — project list and week queries fall back when migration `015` columns are missing

### v0.1.12

**Submit landing URL resolution**

- **Submit URL** — pasted paths (e.g. `https://repazy.com/dashboard`) resolve to the **site root** for preview, screenshot, and DB save — avoids login-gated app routes
- **`normalizeProjectSubmitUrl()`** — canonical helper in `app/lib/projects/project-utils.ts`; strips path, query, and hash to `/`
- **Wired through** — `fetchProjectMeta`, `/api/project-preview`, `/api/projects/check-url`, `POST /api/projects`, `submit-product-form.tsx`

### v0.1.11

**Real leaderboard, publish & promote**

- **Home feed** — `getBattleWeekProducts()` loads **published** projects for the displayed ISO week; empty state when no entries
- **Promoted slots (DB)** — migration `014_promoted_slots.sql`; `buildLeaderboard()` inserts booked spots from `promoted_slots` (not mock names)
- **Publish** — `POST /api/projects/[id]/publish`; **My Projects** modal for any draft (see v0.1.13 for target-week rules); one published project per user per target week
- **Promote** — `POST /api/projects/[id]/promote`; modal to pick spot 1–3 (before #1 / after #5 / after #10); badge + highlighted row on home feed
- **Product pages** — `/products/[id]` resolves published projects from DB; mock fallback for legacy demo IDs
- **RLS** — `projects_select_published` lets anyone read published rows; `promoted_slots` public select + owner insert
- **Lib** — `get-battle-week-bounds`, `is-project-in-battle-week`, `project-to-product`, `format-maker-handle`

### v0.1.10

**Home battle week UX, rules sidebar & single source of truth**

- **Display week resolution** — `getHomeBattleWeek()` skips disabled weeks to the next enabled week; shared by home hero, sidebar rules, and submit flow
- **Battle hero** — four status badges (waiting / awaiting voting / voting open / closed); dynamic voting countdown; min-project progress bar; submit price as `N point(s) per submit`; battle-start hours from admin settings (bold in copy)
- **Sidebar rules** — “This week's battle rules” with dynamic entry fee, min projects, voting hours, one product per user per week, one vote per day, pre-voting shuffle policy
- **Pre-voting shuffle** — `prepareProductFeedOrder()` shuffles on the server each refresh until voting opens; fixes client hydration mismatch from `Math.random()` in `ProductFeed`
- **Submit flow** — `/submit` and side panel use `getHomeBattleWeek()` (no hardcoded `20 projects` / `24h` / site-only price)
- **Consolidated lib** — `mapBattleWeekSettingsRow()`, `resolveEffectiveWeekSettings()` (+ `effectiveProjectsRequired`), `shouldShuffleBeforeVoting()`, `displayStatusToBattlePhase()`, exported `formatPointsAmount()`
- **Cursor rule** — `single-source-of-truth.mdc` documents canonical modules for battle week, formatting, and SSR shuffle

### v0.1.9

**Admin battles polish, per-week settings API & UX**

- **Battles admin** — `/admin-panel/battles` with weekly, monthly, yearly subroutes and large subnav cards
- **Year switcher** — active year default; `?year=` for past years with published entries and next year (planning)
- **Weekly list** — all 52 weeks; scrollable container auto-scrolls to active week; empty weeks show minimal dashed cards
- **Entry counts** — from published projects only (`app/lib/admin-battles/get-records.ts`); no mock winners on admin cards
- **Per-week settings API** — `GET/PATCH /api/battle-week-settings/[year]/[week]` persists to `battle_week_settings` (migration `011`)
- **Settings modal** — enabled toggle, min projects switch + input, submit price override (site default from admin settings)
- **Week badges** — disabled, min projects count, points per submit (`formatDisplayPoints`; badge shows `15 points`, not `€15`)
- **`Tooltip` component** — replaces HTML `title` on battle badges; Cursor rule `tooltips-not-title.mdc`
- **Home weekly battle** — dynamic ISO week + date range via `getCurrentIsoWeek()` and user/site date formatters
- **Header** — desktop user menu no longer locks page scroll (`header-actions.tsx`)
- **Audit** — `battle_week_settings.update` action in admin audit log

### v0.1.8

**Currency display settings**

- **Site default currency** — admin sets EUR, USD, or GBP at `/admin-panel/settings` (Regional defaults; migration `012`)
- **User currency override** — signed-in users set personal currency at `/settings`; null follows site default (migration `013`)
- **Display priority** — user preference → site default → `EUR` fallback; wired through layout provider and price formatters
- **`formatDisplayMoney` / `formatDisplayMoneyWithPoints`** — replace hardcoded `€` on home hero, sidebar, submit flow, and admin price inputs
- **`SiteCurrencySettingsProvider`** + `useSiteCurrency()` for client components; `getEffectiveCurrencyForUser()` on server
- Cursor rule `site-currency-formats.mdc` — agent conventions for currency formatting

### v0.1.7

**Admin battles, battle defaults & user avatars**

- **Battles** admin section — `/admin-panel/battles` with weekly, monthly, and yearly subnav (replaces battle-results placeholder)
- Weekly view — 52 week cards, year switcher, active-week highlight, auto-scroll to current week
- Per-week settings modal — enabled toggle, optional min projects, submit price (API wired in v0.1.9)
- **Battle defaults** in admin settings — default submit price (€) and hours until battle starts from ISO week beginning (migration `010`)
- Entry counts from published projects — `app/lib/admin-battles/get-records.ts`
- **User avatars** — `UserAvatar` + `resolveAvatarUrl`; Google photos in header, settings, admin users, submit sidebar
- CSP `img-src` allows `https://*.googleusercontent.com` for profile images

### v0.1.6

**Deployment docs, env guard & release workflow**

- Supabase env guard (`app/lib/supabase/env.ts`) — `isSupabaseConfigured()`; proxy skips session refresh when env is missing
- Safer server layout when misconfigured — `getCurrentAppUser` and `SiteHeader` no longer crash without Supabase env
- README **Deployment** — full Vercel env table, checklist, troubleshooting (500 / missing URL+Key / localhost redirect)
- README **Environment Variables** — `Where` column (local vs Vercel vs migrations-only)
- README **Changelog** — per-version release notes (`v0.1.0`–`v0.1.7`)
- Cursor rule `readme-version-update.mdc` — README **update** auto-bumps version and changelog

### v0.1.5

**Security hardening & CI**

- SSRF protection for user-supplied URLs (`app/lib/security/safe-url.ts`)
- Safe OAuth `?next=` redirects (`safe-redirect-path.ts`)
- Per-IP rate limits on preview, screenshot, and check-url routes
- Security headers in `next.config.ts` (CSP, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, …)
- Input length limits — API validation + DB constraints (migration `009`)
- Admin audit log (`admin_audit_log`) for settings, role changes, todo actions, and integration CRUD
- Atomic todo board sync via Postgres RPC `sync_admin_todo_board`
- `check-url` requires sign-in; guests rely on server-side duplicate check on save
- Security unit tests (`npm run test:security`)
- GitHub Actions: `security-audit`, `security-smoke`, `secret-scan` (gitleaks)
- Dependabot for npm + GitHub Actions
- Docs: `security-check.md`, `docs/security/csrf-posture.md`, `docs/security/supabase-linter-review.md`
- `npm run db:check-migrations` script
- CI smoke workflow uses non-JWT placeholder env so gitleaks passes

### v0.1.4

**Admin todo UI**

- Todo card layout: title vertically centered when description is empty
- Multiline descriptions render with preserved line breaks (`whitespace-pre-wrap`)

### v0.1.3

**Supabase backend, auth, submissions, admin panel**

- Google sign-in (Supabase Auth) + session refresh via `proxy.ts`
- OAuth callback with optional `?next=` return path
- Two-step **Submit product** flow (URL → review); guest **Login + Save** with post-login auto-save
- Duplicate URL detection by normalized host (signed-in preview check + server-side on save)
- **My Projects** — list, edit, soft-delete, full-page preview
- Project meta fetch (direct + Microlink fallback), favicon, screenshot proxy API
- **User settings** (`/settings`) — date/time format preferences; account side panel
- **Admin panel** — users (admin toggle, last seen), site settings, todo board, projects/battle-results placeholders
- Admin todo board — drag-and-drop columns, trash zones, add/edit modals (`admin_todos`, migration `007`)
- Site-wide date/time display from DB (site defaults + per-user overrides, migration `006`)
- Configurable site name and slogan (`site_settings`, migration `005`)
- Toast feedback + route loading spinners (header/footer stay visible)
- DB migrations `001`–`008` (users, projects, soft delete, last seen, settings, todos, function hardening)
- `npm run db:migrate` + `scripts/test-supabase.mjs`

### v0.1.2

**Documentation**

- Document local dev URL (`http://localhost:3000`) and production URL (`https://battle-drop.vercel.app`) in README and `.env.example`

### v0.1.1

**Documentation**

- Replace Next.js boilerplate README with full project documentation
- Document versioned commit message convention (`… v0.1.x`)

### v0.1.0

**Initial MVP (mock data frontend)**

- Home page — monthly championship banner, weekly battle hero, product leaderboard
- Promoted spot insertions (before #1, after #5, after #10) with demo voting UI
- Product detail pages with comments (mock — replaced by DB in v0.1.18)
- Archive page — season calendar grouped by month
- Site header, footer, mobile nav
- Mock data layer (`mock-data.ts`, `build-leaderboard.ts`, `archive-data.ts`)
- Next.js 16 App Router + Tailwind CSS 4 + Font Awesome

## TODO (recommended next steps)

Practical backlog — ops first, then product. See also [Roadmap](#roadmap) and [`security-check.md`](security-check.md).

### Ops & deploy (do first)

- [ ] **Commit + push `v0.1.19`** — product comments, upvotes, unified product page, admin integrations
- [ ] **Vercel env vars** — copy all four Supabase vars from `.env.local`; set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://battle-drop.vercel.app`
- [ ] **Redeploy** on Vercel after env changes (required — old deploys keep missing env at runtime)
- [ ] **Verify production** — `https://battle-drop.vercel.app/` loads; Google sign-in redirects to prod, not localhost
- [ ] **Migrations 014–024** on production Supabase — `promoted_slots`, battle week columns, `users.points`, `project_comments`, `site_integrations`, `project_comment_upvotes`, `site_polls`, promote duration + slot expiry, affiliates, shop exchange

### Security & quality

- [ ] Enable GitHub **secret scanning push protection** (repo Settings → Code security)
- [ ] Run Supabase **Database Linter** after migrations 008/009; fix any warnings
- [ ] **Global rate limiting** — Upstash Redis, Vercel Firewall, or Cloudflare (in-memory limits don’t span serverless instances)
- [ ] Stricter **CSP** — reduce `'unsafe-inline'` / `'unsafe-eval'` when feasible
- [ ] Add **`Strict-Transport-Security`** header in production (`next.config.ts`)
- [ ] Validate **favicon URL** on project save (SSRF guard, same as preview routes)
- [ ] Expand **security tests** — SSRF/DNS integration cases beyond redirect + IP blocklist

### Admin & observability

- [ ] **Admin audit log UI** — read-only `/admin-panel/audit` for `admin_audit_log`
- [ ] Wire **admin Projects** page (currently placeholder UI)

### Product (replace mock data)

- [x] **Product comments** — DB-backed threads + upvotes on published projects (v0.1.18)
- [ ] **Persistent votes** — home feed vote counts still client-side demo
- [x] **Publish flow** — draft → published weekly battle (v0.1.11)
- [x] **Promoted spot booking** — My Projects modal + `promoted_slots` table (v0.1.11)
- [x] **Promote duration** — admin hours setting + slot `expires_at` (migration `022`, v0.1.22)
- [x] **Promote owner countdown + live expiry** — home feed + My Projects (v0.1.24)
- [x] **`project_promotes` integration gate** — Integrations toggle (v0.1.24)
- [x] **Points deduction** on publish and promote (v0.1.14)
- [x] **Buy points** frontend at `/buy-points` (v0.1.14)
- [x] **Submit side panel** — week card with voting countdown and min-project bar (v0.1.15)
- [x] **My Projects published styling** — battle week status border + shadow (v0.1.16)
- [x] **My Projects preview + comments badge** — published Preview + comment count (v0.1.17)
- [x] **Unified product page** — `/products/[id]` for published + owner preview; launch stats; screenshot (v0.1.18)
- [x] **Admin integrations** page (v0.1.18)
- [ ] **Stripe checkout** — wire buy-points packages to credit `users.points`
- [ ] **Seed** real battles from mock data or admin import
- [x] **Affiliate / referral** system — `/affiliates`, invites, referral cookie (migration `023`, v0.1.25)
- [x] **Shop** — upvote / affiliate → points exchange (migration `024`, v0.1.25)
- [ ] **Payment** step on submit (fiat alternative to points)
